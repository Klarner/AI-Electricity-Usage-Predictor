# AI-Electricity-Usage-Predictor
This project is a artificial intelligence model used for predicting electricity usage based on the given dataset. The dataset used is called 'household_power_consumption' which contains 7 variables and 1 unique varaible used to compare the predicted data which is the result of this model and the actual manually predicted data.

## Instructions
The main.py file is a terminal, you can predict new data with the command 'predict -n'. Make sure you edit or add data in the test.csv file in order to predict new data. If you want to test the prediction, which itself give the same result everytime, use the command 'predict -t' to predict test data. This terminal is still new and early so no other commands contain in this terminal to worry about.

## Other Notes
- Thanks to Dr. Jason Brown for providing the link to the dataset used in this project.
- This project uses Python3.
- The dependencies are the following: numpy, scikit-learn, pandas and matplotlib. All of this dependencies are not manually downloaded but downloaded via anaconda.
